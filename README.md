Blueprint string to paste in Factorio

This is the blueprint for my post on Reddit (same title). Now with added audio from miditorio!
THE	BLUEPRINT	IS MASSIVE and Factorio may hang, be patient!
When opening the flie, click "view raw" to see the string.

There are two "buttons". To "press" them just rotate the inserter. The display should be viewed in editor mode (Ctrl+Shift+F11), there is an optimal zoom level when the wires are barely visible.

The blueprint uses editor extensions by raiguard for larger power pole coverage and I also used quality extensively.

Enjoy!
